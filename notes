favicon -> favorite icon with the title


// Display property pe charcha

inline elements -> we can not control its width, it remains what it requires

block elements ->we can control its width, and two elements can not sit next to each other.

// solution to achieve both
inline-block elements -> we can control its width, and two elements can sit next to each other.

note -> img is inline elements but we can change its height and width.(behaves like inline-block elements)

display : none -> will make the respective element disappear from the web page like it never existed,
 its hidden and it place also get captured by other element.

visibility : hidden -> will make the respective element disappear from the web page but the place which it holds will not be taken by another element

// position p charcha

position: static -> default(follows html flow)

position: relative -> where element was from there we can move it anywhere

position: absolute -> by making any element absolute, its position can be changed respective to it parent element(closest parent that has relative layout)

position: fixed -> stays fixed to provided position(generally used for navbar or side bar to stayed fixed while scrolling through page)


// Font Styling

font embedding -> a process to render text in desired font family(embedding font)

steps -> go to Goggle fonts - https://fonts.google.com/
      -> search respective font
      -> then select this style respective
      -> view selected family - from there copy links and paste in head section
      -> copy css rule for fonts from there only and apply on respective text

// for gif -> https://giphy.com/


// SIZE

static size unit -> px(remain same if we change font-size in setting)

dynamic size unit -> % em rem(changes if we change font-size in setting)

note:

    -> % em
    if body
    {
        font-size : 2em;
    }

    h1
    {
        font-size : 5.625em or %;
    }
    will make font more bigger but it doesnt happen in px if both having size as px.

    thats why use rem  which is dynamic and also set size from its root not inherited size
